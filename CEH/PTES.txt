Exercise — Matching Tasks to Phases
Welcome!
In this exercise, you’ll play the role of a security analyst at X Corp responsible for identifying which reports of malicious activity should be mitigated first.
You will be solving this problem because X Corp has identified more incidents than it has resources to respond to, and thus must prioritize which issues to address now and which to defer until later.

Your task is to read the below descriptions of malicious activity and identify which phase of the hacking cycle each attacker is in. Then, you’ll determine which three are closest to breaching the network.
Be sure to ask your instructors and classmates for help when you get stuck.
Good luck!
